# asp_net_core_mysql_eshop

My 4th year high school programming project, webapi backend with razor front-end 

html/css is heavily inspired by this demo web https://debra-demo.myshopify.com/ but code is completady different

DBS file probably lost so rip

Its here just to remember, what trash i did in the past when i was learning .NET/html/css
